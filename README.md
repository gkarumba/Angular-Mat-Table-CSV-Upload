# Angular Mat-Table

This is a test project to demonstrate uploading a csv file and mapping the columns to already existing fields. 

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gkarumba/Angular-Mat-Table-CSV-Upload.git
cd Angular-Mat-Table-CSV-Upload
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on port `3000`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
